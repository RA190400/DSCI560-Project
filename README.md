# Advanced Virtual Teaching Assistant Platform for USC

This project involves the development of an **Advanced Virtual Teaching Assistant Platform** aimed at providing efficient and accurate Q&A support for USC students. The platform is built using several advanced Python libraries and incorporates cutting-edge technologies like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance user experience.

## Key Features:
- **Real-time Q&A Support**: Integrated automated data scraping and context matching allow the platform to provide instant, accurate responses to student queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: USC course data is stored in a **Faiss database**, enabling efficient and contextually relevant information retrieval for answer generation.
- **Multimedia Support**: The platform not only delivers textual answers but also provides **YouTube links** and **images** from study documents to enhance understanding.

## Methodology:
- **Python Libraries**: Utilized libraries such as **spaCy** for natural language processing, **Langchain** for chaining complex tasks, **NetworkX** for graph-based data structures, and **Streamlit** for the interactive web interface.
- **Automated Data Scraping**: Integrated automated data scraping techniques to pull in USC course data, ensuring that the platform's knowledge base is continuously up-to-date.
- **Context Matching**: Implemented a robust context-matching system to ensure the system provides relevant answers based on the exact context of student queries.
- **Faiss Database**: The data is indexed and stored in a **Faiss** database to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval.
  
## Results:
- **40% reduction in response time** due to efficient data handling and retrieval mechanisms.
- **85% user satisfaction** with the system, attributed to accurate, context-rich responses and enhanced multimedia support (YouTube links and images).

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced AI techniques in creating a virtual teaching assistant that can significantly improve the student experience. By combining **real-time Q&A**, **efficient data retrieval**, and **multimedia support**, the platform provides a rich, interactive environment for students to engage with their coursework.
